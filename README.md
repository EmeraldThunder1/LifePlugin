# LifePlugin

Life plugin is a spigot plugin that can give each player a specific number of lives.
The number of lives can be edited in the config.yml file along with some other settings that don't presently do anything.
As well as this, 'life containers' (totems of undying) can be found in a variety of different structures. Upon moving this to your inventory you will gain an extra life.

A future version of this plugin may stop evokers from dropping their totems.
